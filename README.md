# Hello, World!

Welcome to my personal portfolio site. This site exist for me to log some of the work I am undertaking to enhance my development and data science skills. Most of the posts on here can be found by exporing my github repo, but using this site allows me to tailor the UI to meet my needs.

The site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), using the [Chripy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme, and hosted on [GitHub](https://pages.github.com). I chose this route as I wanted to put this together rapidly and launch it with a minimum viable product (MVP). The advantage of doing this is that I can gather feedback from friends colleages and potential future employers. I expect in some future project I will update this with my own code, but for now I thought it better to be upfront with the source of the code I used. I choose to host on GitHub as it is where I host all of my development projects, as well as other files that need backing up and syncing such as my dotfiles. For code that requires PHP or Node.js I will host it on an Oracle VPS, although the source-code will still be on GitHub.
