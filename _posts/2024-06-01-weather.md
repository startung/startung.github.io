About half the "X portfolio projects" videos the YouTube algorithm suggests to me seem to feature a weather app. I suspect half the API calls to [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org) are people just following these tutorials. However, I am not one to swim against the tide, so I submit my entry which I hope will one day grace the list of 1 million greatest weather apps. My little nod to uniqueness is to add support for the command line. I spend too long in the linux command line, I therefore wanted my contribution not to be a website, but also support the cli. So if you `curl https://rawlings.cloud/weather/` you will get back the current weather in Groningen formatted for the command line, you could also just look out the window, but the world does not always support dark mode.

### Notes

- [code](https://github.com/startung/weather) is in PHP
- hide your API key in a .env file
