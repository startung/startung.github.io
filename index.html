        <section id="data-science">
            <h2>Data Science</h2>
            <p>Data science is one of the best applications of machine learning. When combined with the right domain
                knowledge, it can be used to solve real-world problems and improve lives.</p>

        <section id="maker">
            <h2>Maker</h2>
            <p>I am a maker of both hardware and software. I enjoy building, breaking and fixing things, it is through
                this
                I really develop my understanding of how things work.</p>

        <section id="retro-computing">
            <h2>Retro Computing</h2>
            <p>I am a retro computing enthusiast. Whilst nostalgia plays a role, retro computing applies constraints
                that force you to think differently about how you solve problems. Can you develop AI on a BBC Micro with
                64k of RAM? Can you develop a game thats fun without the graphical abilities of a modern GPU?</p>
